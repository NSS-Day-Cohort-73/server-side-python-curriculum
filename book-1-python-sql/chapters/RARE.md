# Rare Publishing Platform Notes

Our client, Rare Publishing, needs a new application built for their readers. Currently, readers can submit new articles through the mail and once month Rare sends out a Zine of articles that the publishers liked the most. They've finally decided that the internet is not a fad and want a new way for readers view posts.

The finished application will give users the ability to submit, update and comment on posts. The posts will also be organized by tags and categories making it easier for the reader to find the posts they are searching for.

The previous dev team was able to complete the client and server side portions of login and register. It is up to you to complete the remaining tickets. It is also up to you to decide how many of those tickets you will complete in the first sprint.

Take a few hours to look over the remaining tickets, ERD, and wireframes. Think about what needs to be completed on the server and client side for each ticket to be considered "Done". Write any notes you might have for each ticket as needed in github and ask any clarifying questions you have.

Once you have an idea of how many tickets your group can complete this sprint let your Product Manager know.

## Getting Started

2. Click on the **Projects** tab at the top.
3. At the top of this view, you will see a green **Link a project** button, click on the down arrow on the right of it.
4. Choose **New project** then click on the green button.
5. Choose **Board** from the types on the window that appears.
6. Enter in the name of your product in the **Project Name** input field at the top.
7. Click green **Create project** at the bottom.
8. Add a **Backlog** column and move it to be the first column on the left.

### Adding Story Points

1. Watch the [Planning Poker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxSzo3lwwWQ) video to learn about the process of weighing your tickets for Sprint Planning
2. You will be adding story points to the first 15 tickets only.
3. Use the [planningpokeronline.com](http://planningpokeronline.com/) site to start weighing your tickets.
4. When you are done with the first 15 tickets, discuss how many you feel you can complete in the Sprint.
5. Move those to the **To Do** column

### Strategies for Completing Tickets

1. You should not have more than 2 tickets in the **In Progress** column at any time that are assigned to a single teammate.
2. When you move a ticket into the **In Progress** column, you are taking ownership of the entire feature. You can pull in other teammates to share in the responsiblity of building, but you are the owner of it and must ensure quality and completeness.
3. Once the code has been approved, you can consider the coding of the feature done and you can move the ticket to the **Done** column.

## Project Directories

You'll be working in two separate repos for the project. One for the client and one for the server. One person will create the repos using github classroom. Then, everyone will do the following:

1. Create a directory that will hold both github repos. For example, `~/workspace/python/rare`.
2. `cd` to that directory.
3. Clone the client and server side repos into this folder.

## ERD

The database development team has already taken a stab at the [ERD for this project](https://drawsql.app/nss-2/diagrams/rare-v1). You will use this to start building the project.
