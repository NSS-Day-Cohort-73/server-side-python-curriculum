# Python and SQL Reflections

This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned in this project and collect your thoughts on the following questions. Part of becoming a high-value software developer is understanding key concepts... not just the ability pattern match and write code.

When you are done reflecting on these topics and feel that you have a solid understanding of each one, reach out to an instructor for a vocabulary review to ensure you are prepared for technical interviews.


## What You Should Know

We will not be discussing these questions during the interview, because we expect you to have this knowledge. It is your job to ensure that you have the understanding and vocabulary for them.

### `if` Statements

2. Do I understand how to use `elif` and `else` in conjunction with `if`?
3. What is the difference between using `==` and `is` / `is not` with an `if` statement?
4. How would I check to see if a dictionary had a key with an `if` statement?

### `for` Loops

1. Can I write a `for` loop to iterate over elements in a list or tuple?

### Functions

1. Am I able to define and call a function in Python?
2. Do I understand the concepts of function arguments and return values?
3. Can I describe the technical difference between a method and a function?
4. What do I need to do to invoke a function that is defined in a different module?

## Concepts and Vocabulary We Will Discuss

These questions will be discussed during our interview, but we will not review the actual code.

### Classes

- What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP)?
- How does defining a class differ from instantiating an object of that class?

### Modules

1. Can I explain what a Python module is and why it is useful?
2. Do I know how to import and use functions from a module?
3. What are the benefits of packages when developing Python projects?


### HTTP Response Codes

1. When a server throws an unexpected exception, which status code should I send to the client in the response?
2. If the client requested a supported resource that doesn't exist, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
3. If the client did not send all of the required data in the payload of the request, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
4. If the client tries to perform an action _(GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE)_ that isn't supported by the API, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?

## Code Review

These questions will be part of a code review of Kneel Diamonds, so you will be asked to share your screen.

### Data Structures

1. Can I create, modify, and access elements in a Python list?
1. If I was asked in an interview to describe a dictionary, what would I say?
3. Do I understand how to access and modify values based on keys in a dictionary?
1. Do I know the difference between an object and a dictionary in Python?
4. What can an object do that a dictionary can't?

### Try/Except

1. Can I explain the purpose of a `try/except` block in Python?

### SQL

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
1. Am I able to write a basic SQL query to select a single record from a database table?
1. Can I construct a SQL query to join two tables and select multiple records?
1. Am I capable of using the `WHERE` clause to filter records in a SQL query?
2. Do I understand how to combine `WHERE` with other SQL clauses like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`?
