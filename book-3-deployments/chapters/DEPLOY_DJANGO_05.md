# Step 5: Production Environment Variables

Next, you need to define the environment variables you declared in your projectâ€™s settings. For your Django app to function, you need to set the following environment variables.

1. Click the **Edit** link in the **Environment Variables** section.
2. Click the **Add from .env** choice, and a dialog box will appear.
3. Open your `.env` file that you created in the previous step and copy/pasta the contents into the dialog.
4. Change **DEBUG** to `False`.
5. Change **DEVELOPMENT_MODE** to `False`.
6. Change **ALLOWED_HOSTS** to include the URL for your deployed client _(e.g. `'127.0.0.1,localhost,www.awesomeapi.com')_
7. Add the following key/values.
    ```txt
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=${APP_DOMAIN}
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
    ```

8. Click **Save**.
9. Click the **Close** link for that section to save changes.
